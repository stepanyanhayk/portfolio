                    <p>I am a software engineer at Google, where I develop machine learning and data solutions to simplify and accelerate the deployment of hardware on Google’s data centers, the largest, most energy, and cost-efficient distributed computing infrastructure in the world. I work with data from the hardware and low-level software qualification process.

                        <p>As an intern at Google’s Cloud Networking EngProd team, I developed a flag synchronization service to prevent incidents, added a feature that synchronizes pull requests, and developed a library that facilitates load testing with regionally selected flags on various virtual machine controllers. These projects reduced production outages by 7% and improved the load testing framework’s maintainability.</p>

                        <p>During my internship at Meta, I had the opportunity to work on the Facebook Group Reels and Video recommender system. I built end-to-end personalized and user-interest-based video generators for the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/facebook-communities-summit-2022/#:~:text=Reels%20in%20Groups%20let%20you,connect%20on%20a%20deeper%20level." target="_blank">Facebook group reels distribution</a>. Additionally, I researched and developed an originality-controlled group video generator for the In-Feed recommendations. These efforts collectively increased group reels watch time by 0.5%, resulting in approximately 12 million more user exposures.</p>
