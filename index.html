                    I am a second-year student from Armenia studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
                    I am passionate about artificial intelligence and its applications in finding solutions for real-life 
                    problems. In particular, I am interested in large-scale systems, smart devices, autonomous vehicles, 
                    and financial tech.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also an undergraduate researcher at the School of Interactive Computing working on AutoRally, 
                    an autonomous RC car, under the supervision of Dr. James Rehg and Ph.D. student Jason Gibson.
                    <br><br>
                    Before that, I was a research engineer at HiLearn, where I worked on the long-term market (stocks, bonds, funds) simulation.
