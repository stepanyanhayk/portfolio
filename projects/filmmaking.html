                Since 2016, when I took my first Intro to Filmmaking class at the TUMO Center for 
                Creative Technologies and found this form of art both delightful and fascinating, I have 
                been participating in several filmmaking workshops and projects, during which I had the 
                honor and privilege to work with world-famous film director and producer
                <a href="https://www.persistentproductions.com/our-story" target="_blank">Meghan Shea</a>, 
                cinematographers <a href="https://www.persistentproductions.com/our-story" target="_blank">Michael Rogers</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3290500/bio" target="_blank">Mko Malkhasyan</a>, and editor
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1769389/" target="_blank">Knar Kitabjian</a>.
                <br><br>
                The most successful project I was a part of was the film about an Armenian metalworker 
                Edik Zhamkochyan, who is the only person in the world that creates a unique Armenian 
                goblet Mushurba. The film premiered at TUMO Cinema and was published on TUMOâ€™s Official 
                <a href="https://fb.watch/atFCYn53ge/" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>.
