                Since 2016, when I took my first Intro to Filmmaking class at the TUMO Center for 
                Creative Technologies and found this form of art both delightful and fascinating, I have 
                been participating in several filmmaking workshops and projects, during which I had the 
                honor and privilege to work with world-famous film director and producer Meghan Shea, 
                cinematographers Michael Rogers and Mko Malkhasyan, and editor Knar Kitabjian.
                <br><br>
                The most successful project I was a part of was the film about an Armenian metalworker 
                Edik Zhamkochyan, who is the only person in the world that creates a unique Armenian 
                goblet Mushurba. The film premiered at TUMO Cinema and was published on TUMOâ€™s Official 
                Facebook Page.
