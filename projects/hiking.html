                I developed an end-to-end mobile application for hiking under the supervision of Frank Dellaert. 
                Many hikers often seek recommendations, especially those outside the US where hiking trails do not have 
                directions along the way, on which way to take, or how to tackle some parts of the mountain. By creating 
                this application, we give them a social engagement and community-building opportunity, allowing them to post 
                audios right from the hiking trails. Later, when new users visit the same spots, we provide them with previously 
                recorded audios which can include very important and helpful information (e.g., taking west from here opens a gorgeous 
                view to the highland or do not go north to avoid slippery land). Furthermore, we use GPS to show users their 
                trajectories on the map as well as provide statistics such as current altitude and heading, which can be helpful 
                for the hike.
                If you would like to look at my detailed report please follow this <a href="Hayk-Stepanyan_Spring2022Report.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>.
