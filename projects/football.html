                In 2019, Armenia hosted the final tournament of the UEFA European U-19 Football Championship. 
                During the two weeks of the tournament, I was the team liaison officer and translator of the 
                Italy U-19 team, where I got the unique chance to work with world-famous football coaches and 
                players, such as Mirco Gasparetto, Marco Carnesecchi, and Paulo Gozzi.
                <br><br>
                My responsibilities included communicating with the team manager and coaches, arranging 
                the transportation, advising how to plan daily schedules, booking training fields, solving 
                organizational problems connected with the hotels and stadiums. I not only improved my planning, 
                communication, management, fast decision-making, and non-standard problem-solving skills but 
                also gave me new friends and connections worldwide.
