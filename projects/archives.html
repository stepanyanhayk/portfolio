                In 2018, after finding out that one of the departments of the National Archives of Armenia 
                uses papers and text files to store most of its important data, I volunteered to build a 
                database application to make the data circulation more secure and efficient.
                <br><br>
                The final product was approved by the senior management and was represented to employees 
                together with the user guide and technical documentation.
                <br><br>
                I also submitted the application as my final project for the Pearson International 
                A-Level Applied Information and Communication Technology class and received the 
                highest A* mark.
